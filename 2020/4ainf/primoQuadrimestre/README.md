## [The City of the Future](https://youtu.be/L054Xd97_rk)

When people talk about **smart cities** and the technologies that would make
them so, the edge between actually-possible solutions and science-fiction
ideas is often not very clear, even though the speed of technology development
is only getting faster. [Elon Musk](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Elon_Musk) is
a nerdy CEO who strives to think about exciting-yet-realistic technologies
(and, in general, solutions to problems). The [linked
video](https://youtu.be/L054Xd97_rk) explains some of his ideas, why and how
would their implementation work.

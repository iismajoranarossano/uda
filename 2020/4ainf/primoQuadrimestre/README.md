## [The City of the Future](https://youtu.be/L054Xd97_rk)

When people talk about **smart cities** and the technologies that would make
them so, the edge between actually-possible solutions and science-fiction
ideas is often not very clear, even though the speed of technology development
is only getting faster. [Elon Musk](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Elon_Musk) is
a nerdy CEO who strives to think about exciting-yet-realistic technologies
(and, in general, solutions to problems). The [linked
video](https://youtu.be/L054Xd97_rk) shows some of his ideas and why he
believes they make sense, including

- **electric self-driving land vehicles**:
  - **tunnel networks**
  - **semi-trucks**
  - **autonomous shared cars**
- **reusable rockets as cheap as ordinary aircrafts and capable of
  transporting people or cargo from city to city**: rockets would allow us to
  fly from New York City to Shangai in 39 minutes or Sidney to London in 59
  minutes. If we didn't reuse planes, it would cost up to $250.000.000 to fly
  one way, but because we reuse them tens of thousands of times, it becomes
  affordable. That also applies to rockets! A
  [SpaceX](https://www.spacex.com) rocket costs about $60.000.000, and if we
  could reuse it 1000 times, it would then costs $60.000 per flight and by
  carrying a number of people, we could get the cost of a rocket flight down
  to the price of an economy aircraft ticket.
- **hyperloop**
- **gamified learning**: you may think that this has nothing to do with smart
  cities at first, but ask yourself the question "how should kids and adults
  spend their time in the city of the future, where there are fewer and fewer
  jobs that robots can't do better than us?" Elon says that a universal income
  will be necessary and schools shouldn't make kids go through different
  grades like an assembly line since children have different abilities.
  Schools should instead gamify the learning experience and focus on teaching
  problem solving, ethics and, in general, things that allow one to create and
  understand or predict the future.
